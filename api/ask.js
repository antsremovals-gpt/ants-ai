KNOWLEDGE:
[STORAGE]
Ants Removals offers secure, clean, and fully managed storage solutions for both short-term and long-term needs. Whether you're moving to a new home that's not yet ready or simply require extra space, we provide flexible storage options tailored to your situation.

We use standard wooden storage containers with an internal volume of approximately 250 cubic feet. The internal dimensions of each container are 7ft 2in (2.18m) long × 5ft (1.52m) wide × 7ft 8in (2.34m) high. These breathable wooden containers are dry, clean, and stackable up to 4 high using forklifts. They are ideal for both domestic and commercial storage.

Each container is individually numbered for traceability and maximum security.

Our facility features 24/7 CCTV surveillance and controlled indoor conditions to ensure your items remain dry and safe. Storage is available from as little as one week, with no maximum duration. Upon request, we can arrange the return delivery of your stored items.

We do not charge extra for locks or insurance – our pricing is transparent, and customer satisfaction is a top priority.
